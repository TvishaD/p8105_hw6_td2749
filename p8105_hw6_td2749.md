**OR**: 0.4255117

The above odds ratio indicates that controlling all other variables, the
odds of a homicide being solved is \~57.4% lower (between 44.2% and
67.6%) for a male victim compared to a female victim (in the case of
Baltimore, MA between 2007 and 2017).

**Comment**: Based on the fit model, compared to female homicide victim
cases, amongst major US cities, male homicide victim cases have much
fewer odds to be solved in New York, NY and considerably higher odds in
Albuquerque, NM. In Atlanta, GA and Richmond, VA, male and female
homicide victim cases are equally likely to be solved (equal odds \~1).
In most of the major US cities included in this analysis, cases with
male homicide victims are comparatively (in reference to cases with
female homicide victims) less likely to be solved. Only in 4 cities here
(Nashville TN, Fresno CA, Stockton CA, Albuquerque NM) here, cases with
male homicide victims have higher odds of being solved.

Note: In this context, it is important to consider that odds ratios are
a relative and not an absolute measure of pointing out the differences.
For instance, hypothetically, if it is the case that Albuquerque has
very few female homicide victims and a low solving rate for female
victims, the overall odds ratio would tend to be over-inflated, thereby
casting doubt upon the validity of relative measures with extreme
underlying contexts.

# Problem 3

``` r
birthweight_data = 
  read_csv("./data/birthweight.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(
    babysex = as.factor(babysex),
    frace = as.factor(frace),
    malform = as.factor(malform),
    mrace = as.factor(mrace))
```

    ## Rows: 4342 Columns: 20

- There are no missing values in this dataset (0).

I have decided to use the following variables as main effects for my
model:

- `mrace`: categorical; (1 = White, 2 = Black, 3 = Asian, 4 = Puerto
  Rican, 8 = Other)
- `bhead`: continuous; (baby’s head circumference at birth
  (centimeters) - ranging from 20 to 42 cm.)
- `blength`: continuous; (baby’s length at birth (centimeteres) -
  rannging from 20 to 65 cm.)
- `babysex`: categorical; (baby’s sex (male = 1, female = 2))
- `smoken`: continuous; (average number of cigarettes smoked per day
  during pregnancy - ranging from 0 to 60.)

Following a hypothesized structure, I have included the size of the
baby’s head, length at birth, and gender at birth to encompass
potentially influential physiological aspects. From the mother’s
perspective, I have decided to include race and smoking status as they
are often cited to be instrumental in determining the baby’s physique at
birth.

Here are some exploratory graphs displaying basic underlying 1x1 trends:

``` r
head_bwt = 
  birthweight_data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = bhead, y = bwt)) +
  geom_point(aes(alpha = 0.1, color = mrace))

length_bwt = 
  birthweight_data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = blength, y = bwt)) +
  geom_point(aes(alpha = 0.1, color = mrace))

smoken_bwt = 
  birthweight_data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = smoken, y = bwt)) +
  geom_point(aes(alpha = 0.1, color = mrace))

    ## F-statistic:  1451 on 7 and 4334 DF,  p-value: < 2.2e-16

As revealed in the summary above, every predictor in this case seems to
have a statistically significant effect on the response value (birth
weight).

The considerably high r^2 value: 0.7005 indicates that most of the
variance in the response value can be explained by the variance in the
predictors.

*Analysis*: The model seems to doing fairly well. Apart from some
outliers, most values are equally spread out about the y = 0 line. Based
on the x-axis scale, there seems to be a cluster indicating that most of
the fitted values lie between 2000 and 4000 grams (2 kg - 4 kg) which
makes sense in terms of baby birth weights.

Make this comparison in terms of the cross-validated prediction error;
use crossv_mc and functions in purrr as appropriate.

``` r
cv_df = 
  crossv_mc(birthweight_data, 100)

  cv_df %>% 
  mutate(
    train = map(train, as_tibble),
    test = map(test, as_tibble))

    my_mod = map(train, ~lm(bwt ~ mrace + bhead + blength + babysex + smoken, data = .x)),
    blength_gaweeks_mod = map(train, ~lm(bwt ~ blength + gaweeks, data = .x)),
    bhead_blength_babysex_mod = map(train, ~lm(bwt ~ bhead + blength + babysex + bhead*blength*babysex, data = .x))) %>%

    rmse_my_mod = map2_dbl(my_mod, test, ~rmse(model = .x, data = .y)),
    rmse_blength_gaweeks_mod = map2_dbl(blength_gaweeks_mod, test, ~rmse(model = .x, data = .y)),
    rmse_bhead_blength_babysex_mod = map2_dbl(bhead_blength_babysex_mod, test, ~rmse(model = .x, data = .y)))
```

    everything(),

    values_to = "rmse",

Based on the results of the cross validation, my model seems to be doing
slightly better than the `bhead_blength_babysex_fit`. It has a low RMSE.
